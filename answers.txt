Part 1: Write your message here from GitHub
Hello Jonathan!

Task 1: 
// Under this line, describe what the command 'git fetch' does
This command gets the changes from the remote repository, but does not update the local repository with these changes.
It only gets the changes to tell you if the your local repository is up to date when you run 'git status'.

Task 2:
// Under this line, describe the difference between Git and GitHub
